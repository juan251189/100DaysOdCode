# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Setup prior to challenge
**I did the following before starting this challenge:**
- I had taken some introductory courses on C and Fortran in college, and I have played around with bash scripting, TI-83+ BASIC, HTML, and Javascript.
- Completed the Python 2.7 tutorial on Codecademy

    [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- Completed Project Euler problems 1-50 using basic Python scripts

    [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
- Read about half of "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python". I'll probably end up finishing this book by the end of my 100 days challenge. This is a great resource when you're new to Python. I recommend that you follow the author, @AlSweigart, on Twitter.

    [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
- Wrote some basic Python scripts for work
- Installed PyCharm on my PC

    [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- Set up my GitHub account

    [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Integrated PyCharm with GitHub
    - This required that I first install Git to my local PC
    
        [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - I then had to set up PyCharm for Git integration

### Day 1: Thursday November 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I went through Warmup-1 > sleep_in on CodingBat, and completed Challenge 1 from PyBites

**Thoughts**: I didn't make much progress today, and I felt that every single step was a struggle. I'm looking forward to getting better at this!

### Day 2: Friday, November 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Challenge 2 from PyBites, it's still a work in progress.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I made even less progress than yesterday, but I feel like I spent less time looking at documentation and more time trying to figure out the logic of my program. I'm not sure if this is good, but it feels like I'm making progress. I also feel like I was thinking about Python pretty much all day yesterday, and I was excited to start coding this morning, so that's good!

### Day 3: Saturday, November 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Challenge 2 from PyBites, it's still a work in progress. This challenge runs now, but it doesn't give me the expected output and I'm still debugging a couple functions in the program. I learned about using os.chdir() and sys.path.append() in IDLE to debug problem functions that reference local file paths, which was pretty helpful for this particular challenge.

**Thoughts**: I probably spent about half an hour writing code today, and about 2 hours debugging what I had written. It's been very slow progress, but I was finding issues at a rate of about one every 20 minutes. I feel like I'm at the point today where staring at code isn't going to help anymore, and I need to look at this more tomorrow. Overall, it's been a mix of enjoyment and frustration.

### Day 4: Sunday, November 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finally finished challenge 2 from PyBites! I also completed the Python Village at Rosalind and started challenge 3 on PyBites.

**Thoughts**: I'm really happy I got challenge 2 done. I found that I was missing a few silly things that were pretty much obvious this morning. I also watched the new tutorial videos from sentdex on Youtube last night, and that helped a lot. The Rosalind problems are a little different pace than the PyBites challenges. I think I like working on the longer PyBytes challenges more, but Rosalind will help me to get used to writing smaller scripts for easier problems. I'll probably continue with a mix of both tomorrow.

### Day 5: Monday, November 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still working on challenge 3 from PyBytes, I think I'm at least halfway through.

**Thoughts**: I'm starting to grasp some concepts that gave me trouble earlier. I can feel my programming skills improving, which is good to see. I still feel like I'm very slow at writing code, but hopefully I'll get better with time.

### Day 6: Tuesday, November 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished challenge 3 from PyBites! I was almost finished with it yesterday, and wrapping it up was easier than I thought. I started on challenge 4 from PyBites and probably spent about 20 minutes today just getting my Twitter developer account set up.

**Thoughts**: I had a decent amount of progress today. The new PyBites challenge requires a lot of scary advanced Python concepts that I've been avoiding, like classes and constructors. I'm excited to dig more into those tomorrow.

### Day 7: Wednesday, November 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still working on challenge 4 from PyBites, I think I'm about halfway through?

**Thoughts**: I went through a lot of new stuff today. This was my first time using classes and constructors in Python. It was also the first time I used an API! I think I can get this challenge finished tomorrow. I have also started debugging early by printing the output of each function once I'm done with it, and making sure the function works before moving on to the next function. I'm sure this will save me time at the end when I'm trying to run the whole program.

### Day 8: Thursday, November 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still working on challenge 4 from PyBites, I'm almost done!

**Thoughts**: A lot more progress today! I'm thinking I might take a break from PyBites after this challenge and try some other challenges, maybe Rosalind? I'm learning a ton on the PyBites challenges, but I want to get used to programming with no starting template or logic. Also, I think easier challenges will build my confidence and reinforce the basics.

### Day 9: Friday, November 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed challenge 4 from PyBites, compeleted 4 Rosalind challenges. I'm working on the first "hard" Rosalind challenge, Mendel's First Law.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I decided to circle back and do some more basic scripting today. I had to refer to a book a couple times, but I didn't feel like I spent a lot of time trying to find out what I'm doing wrong. I'm going to finish this next Rosalind challenge, then go back to PyBites.

### Day 10: Saturday, November 10th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Rosalind challenge, Mendel's First Law, but I wasn't able to make any progress on it. I think I'm limited on that problem by my understanding of probability and math, not by my programming knowledge. I stopped working on the Rosalind challenge, looked at PyBites challenge 5, then decided to go through some CodingBat challanges. I was able to fly through the CodingBat warmup 1, which is good to see.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I decided to do the CodingBat challenges, because it let me actually spend my hour writing code rather than trying to learn probability or set everything back up for PyBites challenge 5.

### Day 11: Sunday, November 11th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on PyBites challenge 5. I think I made some good progress, and I hope to have it finished by tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: PyBites challenge 5 seems easier today than it did yesterday, but maybe that's just because I spent some time digging into it. I looked at the suggested package, Gensim, and that looks pretty complex. I might just come up with my own topic matching method tomorrow so I can get this challenge completed. I feel like programming is getting a little easier every day.

### Day 12: Monday, November 12th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished PyBites challenge 5, and technically finished PyBites challenge 6, since PyPI already has more than 100,000 packages. I'm going with the spirit of the challenge, though, so tomorrow I'll be working on PyBites challenge 6 to find out when PyPI will have more than 200,000 packages.

**Thoughts**: Lots of good progress today. I like how the PyBites challenges are transitioning from a starting template to a blank file. The starting template was helpful in the beginning, but I wasn't sure whether I'd be able to figure the program out on my own.

### Day 13: Tuesday, November 13th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working on PyBites challenge 6.

**Thoughts**: I got some good practice working with the PyPI API, but I've only been able to get information about updates to packages so far. I haven't found a good way to find out when new packages were added to PyPI.

### Day 14: Wednesday, November 14th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working on PyBites challenge 6.

**Thoughts**: I think I came up with a clever way to get info on when packages were first added to PyPI. I'm not sure I know how to analyze that and make a decent prediction, but that's a problem for tomorrow.

### Day 15: Thursday, November 15th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working on PyBites challenge 6.

**Thoughts**: I was able to pull the full list of all packages from PyPI, then get the first upload dates for every hundredth package. I'm pretty sure I need a linear regression to predict when PyPI will hit 200,000 packages, but first I need to use my list of dates to get a number of packages per day.

I really didn't think this challenge would be this difficult, but I'm learning a ton!

### Day 16: Friday, November 16th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working on PyBites challenge 6.

**Thoughts**: I'm getting closer every day. I have the running total of packages by date, now I just need to turn that into something that can make a prediction. I hope to have this finished tomorrow.

### Day 17: Saturday, November 17th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working on PyBites challenge 6.

**Thoughts**: Still working on it! I'm pretty sure I got the data to a state where I can run analysis on it, but I can't make heads or tails of the output. I might do another challenge tomorrow while I brush up on statistics.

### Day 18: Sunday, November 18th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I went through 6 Automate the Boring Stuff with Python practice projects.

**Thoughts**: Wow, I was able to do these projects at a rate of 1 every 10 minutes! That's 2-3x faster than it took me months ago when I first started reading ATBS!

### Day 19: Monday, November 19th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I went through some more Automate the Boring Stuff with Python practice projects.

**Thoughts**: I wasn't able to get as many projects done today, or get the last project to work at all. Still, I feel pretty good about what I was able to do today.

### Day 20: Tuesday, November 20th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I made Conway's game of life!

**Thoughts**: I thought I'd do a fun project today, so I built Conway's game of life! I'm really pleased that I was able to completely code this and get it running in an hour!

### Day 21: Wednesday, November 21st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I completed Project Euler problems 1 and 2, and got started on 3. I'm forcing myself to use at least one class, list comprehension, or lambda in the solution for each problem, even if (especially if) it seems easier to use other methods.

**Thoughts**: I feel a little more comfortable with these problem topics, but it's also kind of difficult to force them into a program. I'm planning on continuing to force myself to use these through day 25, and hopefully that'll teach me what these things are actually useful for.

### Day 22: Thursday, November 22nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Project Euler problem 3. I wasn't able to complete it, or find a way to make it go any faster.

**Thoughts**: Not much progress today, but I think at least part of that is from coding after eating a bunch of turkey for Thanksgiving. I got my hour in, though!

### Day 23: Friday, November 23rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Project Euler problems 3, 4, 5, and 6. I think I figured out how to make problem 3 go faster, but I didn't have time to implement it.

**Thoughts**: More progress today! I don't think classes are helpful for the short programs I'm writing, but I'm still playing with them to get used to them. I'm feeling pretty good about list comprehensions, not really sure about lambdas yet.

### Day 24: Saturday, November 24th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Project Euler problems 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10. I started to work on problem 11, but I ran out of time.

**Thoughts**: I think I'm doing pretty good. List comprehensions are starting to be easy, lambdas seem to be easy (but don't really save much code) and classes seem to just be used for one function. I think once I get into some more advanced Python projects I'll see the benefit of these features, but I find myself just wanting to use list comprehensions for now.

### Day 27: Tuesday, November 27th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Project Euler problems 51, 52, 53, and 54.

**Thoughts**: I think I made some good progress today, and it makes sense to use a class for problem 54, so that's good. I'm looking forward to working with a "real" class tomorrow on problem 54.

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Project Euler problem 54.

**Thoughts**: A whole month of coding is behind me! That's pretty awesome! This Project Euler program feels like I'm fighting a Hydra - more and more difficult problems keep popping up. However, I'm making good progress, and I'm coding a lot!

### Day 34: Tuesday, December 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Advent of Code problem 3.1. It's pretty tough!

**Thoughts**: This problem's pretty tough! I think I got a solution, but the program is taking forever to complete. I probably need to optimize this somehow.

### Day 35: Wednesday, December 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Advent of Code problems 3.1, 3.2, and 4.1.

**Thoughts**: These are tough, but I like them a lot! I also realized that it takes HOURS for Python to continually add to a long long list, but it takes only seconds for it to write the same amount of data to a file. That probably has something to do with the fact that the whole list is in memory the whole time, vs. just tacking on another line to a file. It's funny to think that I made Advent of Code problem 3.1 run faster by using storage rather than memory!

### Day 38: Saturday, December 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Advent of Code problems 6.1 and 7.1.

**Thoughts**: I think I found the solution for 6.1, but it looks like it'll take about an hour and a half to complete. I guess that's what happens when the requirements say to calculate distance to points on an infinite field! I'm not actually calculating an infinite field for that one, but I am having my code go through way more points than is probably necessary.

### Day 39: Sunday, December 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Advent of Code problems 6.1 and 7.1.

**Thoughts**: I didn't get much done today, but that can partly be blamed on an internet outage. The majority of the blame lies with me, though. I did have fun coding, I just didn't find any correct answers to coding challenges.

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Advent of Code problems 6.2, 7.1, and 8.1.

**Thoughts**: I spent most of my time debugging 7.1. I got the right answer yesterday, but that was by checking my results line by line and finding where my program went off track. I think I ran into a weird python issue on 7.1, but I asked for some help in a forum to make sure I'm not missing something simple.

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Advent of Code problems 7.1, 7.2, and 8.1.

**Thoughts**: I figured out what I was doing wrong on 7.1, and I spent most of the rest of my time trying to work out the logic for 7.2 and 8.1. I think I have an idea of how to approach 8.1, but I'm still lost on 7.2.

### Day 44: Friday, December 14th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Advent of Code problem 8.1 and played around with Pygame.

**Thoughts**: I was debugging 8.1, and my PC hit a blue screen of death. I fired up my Fedora laptop that I just use for coding, and played around with Pygame instead. I might have a few ideas for fun projects with Pygame.

### Day 45: Saturday, December 15th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I solved Advent of Code problem 8.1, and I played around with Halite.

**Thoughts**: I've been running into a lot of problems with Advent of Code, mostly because I'm not really good at programming. It looks like Halite and Pygame are fun, I'll probably play with those for a while.

### Day 52: Saturday, December 22nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the archer game.

**Thoughts**: It's starting to look more like a game! It actually requires end user intervention to fire the arrow, but that's it for now. I'll add in some aiming next.

### Day 53: Sunday, December 23rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the archer game. I tried to get the arrow to rotate, but it didn't work.

**Thoughts**: Wow, rotation in pygame is kinda tough to do. I'll keep trying though!

### Day 54: Monday, December 24th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the archer game. I got the arrow to rotate and follow an arc, like it's supposed to.

**Thoughts**: I figured out that if I rotate an original image more and more, rather than continually rotating the same image, it works a lot better. I think that's because pygame doesn't preserve the image properly through multiple transforms.

### Day 55: Tuesday, December 25th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the archer game. I added more functionality, so now a player actually has some input on where the arrow goes!

**Thoughts**: Coding on Christmas is tough!

### Day 61: Monday, December 31st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still working on getting PyTone to work with Python 3 in Windows 10.

**Thoughts**: I mostly worked with classes today. I don't know that much about classes to begin with, and it looks like there were some pretty major changes between 2 and 3!

### Day 62: Tuesday, January 1st, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still working on getting PyTone to work with Python 3 in Windows 10. I didn't really make any progress today, I'm hitting the same error that I was hitting yesterday.

**Thoughts**: I'm disappointed that I didn't make any progress today, but I think I learned a bit about how this was built.

### Day 63: Wednesday, January 2nd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still working on getting PyTone to work with Python 3 in Windows 10. I made it past the class error from yesterday, but now I'm running into an issue where PyTone can't reach my music directory.

**Thoughts**: I'm happy to finally get an error that's due to a configuration issue, rather than an exception in code.

### Day 64: Thursday, January 3rd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I got PyTone to work on Fedora, mostly. I'm not sure I'll be able to get it to work in Windows without a full rebuild.

**Thoughts**: I think I'm gonna make my own version of a PyTone-like player on Windows. That should be more fun than plugging away at doing 2 ports at once.

### Day 65: Friday, January 4th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started working on making a music player in Python. I had issues getting a package that would play a mp3 file properly.

**Thoughts**: Ran into some trouble today. Hopefully once I have the right packages, I can actually get something working.

### Day 66: Saturday, January 5th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: The music player now plays music and shows the number of seconds elapsed in the song compared to the total. However, it also stops playing music for around 0.1 second, once per second.

**Thoughts**: Something that works! It doesn't work well, but it works!

### Day 83: Tuesday, January 22nd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting music to play, I tried some different modules.

**Thoughts**: Music plays now, but I can't figure out how to stop it. I looked at some different modules to see if I can find out how they did it. I might switch to a different module for playing music.

### Day 84: Wednesday, January 23rd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting music to play, I tried using python-vlc.

**Thoughts**: It seems like VLC for media is the easiset solution, and it seems to play both FLAC and MP3 files just fine, which is good. I tried to stay away from it at first, because now this project just seems like a CLI skin for VLC. However, if that's what I have to do to have a working project, that's what I'll do.

### Day 91: Wednesday, January 30th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the media player interface.

**Thoughts**: I spent about 30 minutes today trying to figure out why the interface wouldn't display with the foreground in yellow properly. I realized that this was because I'm using Flux, and my whole screen is kinda yellow. I couldn't notice the difference between white and yellow! I feel silly.

### Day 93: Friday, February 1st, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the media player interface.

**Thoughts**: I found a way to determine the total length of a song, and I can probably use the time module to determine with a decent amount of accuracy what the current time of a playing song is. Displaying that is another matter. I think I'm going to have to figure out how to use asyncio.

### Day 94: Saturday, February 2nd, 2019

### Day 96: Monday, February 4th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I got multiproccessing to work, finally. I still need to work on implemting it into the main program, but maybe that'll be on the next 100 days of code! I also worked on getting the main program back into a working state from before I tried to implement gevent.

**Thoughts**: Finally done! I'm a little disappointed that I wasn't able to finish my media player program, but I did get something that I can use to play at least one song at a time. But that's overshadowed by how excited I am to not have to code tomorrow!
